Setup SSH --> Password less Communication between Controller and Manage Node

1. SSH Key Setup:
Generate a key pair on the control node:
If you don't have an SSH key, use the ssh-keygen command to create one.
Copy the public key:
Locate the public key file (usually ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) and copy its contents.

Add the public key to the managed node:
Log into the managed node via SSH (if you already have a key set up).
Create the .ssh directory if it doesn't exist (mkdir -p ~/.ssh).
Create the authorized_keys file if it doesn't exist (touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys).
Open the authorized_keys file and paste the public key from the control node into it.
Change the file permissions to restrict access (chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys).
